= FERIN Interpretation Companion launched alongside ISO 19135:2026

We are pleased to announce the launch of the https://www.ferin.org[FERIN
Interpretation Companion], a comprehensive resource for practitioners working
with item registration and information management.

== What is FERIN?

**FERIN** (Framework for Extensible Registration of Information) provides a
standardized approach for managing collections of information—code lists,
taxonomies, specifications, and reference data—that must remain accessible and
usable over time.

The framework addresses fundamental challenges that organizations face:

* **Persistent identification**: References that don't break when content changes
* **Controlled evolution**: Defined governance processes for managing change
* **Complete audit trails**: Full history and traceability of all modifications
* **Technology neutrality**: No implementation-specific requirements
* **Domain agnostic**: Applicable to any domain, not just geographic information

The FERIN name was coined by Ronald Tse and Reese Plews, and the trademark is
held by the Enosema Foundation.

== Relationship to ISO 19135:2026

ISO 19135:2026, published on 2026-02-05, is the third edition of the international
standard for item registration. Developed by https://committee.iso.org/home/tc211[ISO/TC 211]
(Geographic Information/Geomatics), this edition represents a significant
evolution from its 2015 predecessor:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| 2015 Edition | 2026 Edition

| Focus on geographic information
| Domain-agnostic framework

| Procedural requirements
| Conceptual framework with principles

| Hierarchical conformance (Core/Extended/Hierarchical)
| Capability-based conformance (5 classes)

| Implementation included (XML)
| Technology-neutral
|===

The standard was developed under the project leadership of Ronald Tse
(CalConnect/Ribose) and Reese Plews (JISC Japan/Plews Consulting).

The full standard is available at https://www.iso.org/standard/87753.html[ISO 19135:2026].

== The FERIN Interpretation Companion

While ISO 19135:2026 specifies *what* must be done, the
https://www.ferin.org[FERIN Interpretation Companion] provides the *how* and
*why*—practical guidance, decision frameworks, and implementation patterns that
complement the standard.

The companion covers:

* **Core concepts**: The distinction between concept plane and content plane,
granularity, and the six core principles
* **Building registers**: Identifier design, versioning strategies, action
references, and migration from legacy systems
* **Reference materials**: Complete glossary, conceptual model diagrams, status
and relations references, and anti-patterns to avoid

Whether you are evaluating FERIN for your organization, building a new register,
or migrating from an existing system, the FERIN Interpretation Companion
provides the practical knowledge needed for successful implementation.

== Visit FERIN

We invite all practitioners working with terminology, concept management, and
information registries to explore the FERIN Interpretation Companion at
https://www.ferin.org[www.ferin.org].
