= First Shared Concepts Workshop

== Workshop: "`Achieving a shared understanding of concepts`"

IMPORTANT: The workshop presentations and audio recordings are now available for download on the https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc211/home/standards-in-action/presentation-archive/2021-04-shared-concepts-workshop.html[ISO/TC-211 Presentations Archive]. If you have any questions please contact sharedconcepts at tc211tmg dot org.  Thank you again to all of the presenters and participants. See you again soon!

IMPORTANT: This workshop is finished (üôè to all participants, more than 50 participants on the first day, more than 30 on the second day!).

On the 13th and the 15th of April 2021, a workshop was held for an exchange of views on how to achieve a shared understanding of concepts - terminology and definitions - across domains.

=== Purpose of the Workshop

Have you seen a term defined differently in one place from another?
Do you use or manage standardized terminologies/glossaries/thesauri?
How are these definitions mapped? Perhaps existing
terminologies/glossaries/thesauri can be made more useful in your
day-to-day work.

Many domains, such as geospatial, electro-technical, business and
telecommunications, and others maintain approved terms and
definitions through well-defined procedures, especially at
standardization bodies and consortia. We believe building
mutually-agreed links between concepts across domains would be
useful. How should we tie the concepts together, how can they be
maintained and  governed over time, and who is allowed to do so?

The workshop will focus on discussing a framework and procedures for
tackling these issues and work out any technical details at a later
time.

The ISO/TC 211 Terminology Maintenance Group (TMG) is responsible
for matters relating to terminology within https://committee.iso.org/home/tc211[ISO/TC 211 Geographic information/Geomatics], which
includes the management, harmonization, and promotion of terminology
concepts, and their relationships in ISO/TC 211 deliverables. The
TMG coordinates and publishes a multi-lingual glossary of terms, see
https://github.com/ISO-TC211/TMG.

The https://eng.sdfe.dk/[Danish Agency for Data Supply and
Efficiency] is tasked with ensuring the presence of a sound
foundation of data underpinning decisions and major transitions in
society. In the past, this entailed updating the topographical maps,
which served as the basis for public administration in Denmark. Their
role today, is to ensure that data can effectively meet the new
challenges and unleash the potential of a digital society. This
requires interoperable public sector data, which can be combined and
used with the geographic data foundation. Consequently, the task of
the Danish Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency - as a data
producer, data distributor, data partner and basic data authority -
is to provide the data foundation for a digital Denmark.
